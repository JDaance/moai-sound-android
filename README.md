Utilize Android java sound for less latency and more reliability (possibly)

Its a plugin for MOAI according to the structure for plugins set up by Halfnelson.

Drop the class in java_host_files in the correct zipline package in your Android host. Then add the class to the list in Moai.java
```
	private static String [] sExternalClasses = {
		...
    "com.ziplinegames.moai.MoaiSound",
	};
```

Add the plugin to your build according to https://github.com/moaiforge/moai-sdk/wiki/Using-Plugins

The API for sounds is the same as for UNTZ but I have just implemented the most basic commands. Read more on the 
Moai forum.
